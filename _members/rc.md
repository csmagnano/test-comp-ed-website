The Research Computing (RC) group comprises a diverse team of individuals who collaborate with researchers on their computational needs, advise them on solutions, and implement new ones as needed. RC provides scientific and computing advice to researchers, both in support of the HMS high performance research cluster and towards other specialized and innovative solutions. The Research Data Management team also helps researchers better organize and manage data throughout the research lifecycle.

On occasion, the best solution we can provide is to direct clients to other service providers. We maintain close relationships with many groups including the Harvard Chan Bioinformatics Core, SBGrid Consortium, and Harvard Longwood Medical Area Research Data Management Working Group.
