The Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health (HSPH) has taken a leading role in interdisciplinary research involving the computational analysis of complex relationships between genes and their environment as well as basic biological and quantitative sciences. The Harvard Chan Bioinformatics Core (HBC) is integral to the development and application of computational biology methods at the School.

The HBC provides a single point of contact for Harvard researchers interested in bioinformatics support, applying genomic approaches together with established and developing methodologies from epidemiology, environmental health, biostatistics and bioinformatics to improve human health.

Core staff aid researchers within the Harvard community with the management, integration and contextual analysis of biological high-throughput data, focusing on next-generation sequencing support. We provide training, consulting and advice on best practices, foster collaboration and a community of bioinformatics activities, and build a unified infrastructure supporting a diverse set of experimental systems and high-throughput biological data.
