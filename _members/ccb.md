CCB provides cutting edge computational capabilities, data analysis, and data integration technologies to support medical and biological research and has a strong mandate to serve as a Hub for computational science education across HMS. We are a multi-disciplinary team of computational and quantitative scientists that develops shared data and analytic resources to serve a broad constituency. Additionally, CCB provides project collaboration and hosts skills workshops and guided learnings for HMS Graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, research staff and faculty across all departments of the HMS quadrangle.
